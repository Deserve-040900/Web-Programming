I wanna dance the music got me going ain't nothing that can stop how we move yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden and roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry cause when we fall we know how to land 
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk, tonight
Cause we don't need permission to dance da na na na na na na
